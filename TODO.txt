To do:

- Fix tests when run with feedparser (FeedParser) 5.0.1, as is now
  pinned in Plone 4.2 and 4.3 alpha.  We might just need to do either
  less or more mocking in doc/feedconsuming.txt and make this use a
  real Plone Site.  Currently the mocking of portal_transforms is
  causing problems, but fixing that one simply leads to other
  problems.  All seems fine when used in a normal website.  Also,
  the tests work fine with the old feedparser 4.1.

- Use locales instead of an i18n directory.

- Check if feedfeeder still works on Plone 3, for example the recent
  changes to the types and actions, and if we still want to support
  that.

- Check why 'Feeditem updated' is not available for selecting/sorting
  in new style collections.
